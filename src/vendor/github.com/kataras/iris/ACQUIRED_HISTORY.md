## ðŸ“ˆ One and a half years with Iris and You...

- 7070 github stars
- 749 github forks
- 1m total views at its documentation
- ~800$ at donations (there're a lot for a golang open-source project, thanks to you)
- ~550 reported bugs fixed
- ~30 community feature requests have been implemented

## ðŸ”¥ Reborn

As you may have heard I have huge responsibilities on my new position at Dubai nowadays, therefore I don't have the needed time to work on this project anymore.

After almost a month of negotiations and searching I succeed to find a decent software engineer to continue my work on the open source community.

The leadership of this, open-source, repository was transferred to [hiveminded](https://github.com/hiveminded).

These types of projects need heart and sacrifices to continue offer the best developer experience like a paid software, please do support him as you did with me!

### DEPRECATED

Iris has been acquired so development is up to the community, there are two active iris-based communities so far.

Use one of these projects instead:  

https://github.com/get-ion/ion

**Ion is a fast, simple and efficient micro web framework for Go. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website, API, or distributed app.**

- a bit faster than Iris version 7, based on `ab`
- stable api
- more examples
- sessions, websockets, typescript and cloud editor(fixed) on different packages
- test cov, including examples
- slack bot for support automation
- has a FAQ page which is part of the gitbook.com beta program
- central issue portal
- HuHu supported

https://github.com/go-siris/siris

**A fast, cross-platform and efficient web framework with robust set of well-designed features, written entirely in Go.**

- three maintainers
- plan to stabilize api, no unneeded changes
- plan to increase test-coverage
- plan to add more middlewares and examples

### IRIS HAS BEEN ACQUIRED

Iris project has been acquired by a Dubai-based startup.
 
Both sides agree that every related public data should remain open for at least 30 days.

After the period of 30 days, company has the proprietary rights to delete or transfer this repository and all its related public data forever without any warnings.

The company may or may not reveal its true identity to the public.   

Transaction of the public domains still in-progress:

- http://iris-go.com
- https://kataras.rocket.chat/channel/iris

View-accessed users can clone the current state of the project's public repositories and use without any warranties.

From now on, Original Author owns a high position to the company's table.

At any circumstances, 

Original Author keeps the creation rights.

### About the future of Iris

Clone the repository today because if I can't find a new lead maintainer for the [v7.2](https://github.com/kataras/iris-v7-29d) you, as community, will have to find a way to communicate about its future, the name "iris go" was taken by the company too, so it will be nice if the future main contributor change its name too, if you don't do it I will not beat you but I don't know the full company's law-plan for this, yet.
  
All donators, without any exception, will have my support for at least 6 months (for all iris versions), we have a private room at the [chat](https://kataras.rocket.chat/channel/iris).

Don't worry **I will not let you down**, we're trying to find a decent open-source contributor to continue the Iris' open-source codebase. I'm already in touch with some good gophers but **If you're willing to maintain this project** please [send](#contact) me details about your experience, general bio and your github username.

**I am really thankful for all of your support to me and the community, all donations, all bug reports, all comments without any exception. I did proceeded with all my physical abilities so far but unfortunately there weren't enough for my survivor. I'm really sorry if the latest news made iris open-source community disappointed but you have to see things from my point view, I was one step before bankruptcy, I had no other choice but accept the offer.**
