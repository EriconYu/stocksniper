Iris is a fast, simple and efficient micro web framework for Go. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website, API, or distributed app.

[Star or watch](https://github.com/kataras/iris/stargazers) this repository, it is still in **active development mode**.

### ðŸš€ Installation

The only requirement is the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/dl/), at least version 1.8

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/kataras/iris
```

> _iris_ takes advantage of the [vendor directory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo) feature. You get truly reproducible builds, as this method guards against upstream renames and deletes.

```go
// file: main.go
package main
import (
    "github.com/kataras/iris"
    "github.com/kataras/iris/context"
)
func main() {
    app := iris.New()
    // Load all templates from the "./templates" folder
    // where extension is ".html" and parse them
    // using the standard `html/template` package.
    app.RegisterView(iris.HTML("./templates", ".html"))

    // Method:    GET
    // Resource:  http://localhost:8080
    app.Get("/", func(ctx context.Context) {
        // Bind: {{.message}} with "Hello world!"
        ctx.ViewData("message", "Hello world!")
        // Render template file: ./templates/hello.html
        ctx.View("hello.html")
    })

    // Start the server using a network address and block.
    app.Run(iris.Addr(":8080"))
}
```
```html
<!-- file: ./templates/hello.html -->
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{.message}}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

```sh 
$ go run main.go
> Now listening on: http://localhost:8080
> Application started. Press CTRL+C to shut down.
```

<details>
<summary>Hello World with Go 1.9</summary>

If you've installed Go 1.9 then you can omit the `github.com/kataras/iris/context` package from the imports statement.

```go
// +build go1.9

package main

import "github.com/kataras/iris"

func main() {
	app := iris.New()
	app.RegisterView(iris.HTML("./templates", ".html"))
	
	app.Get("/", func(ctx iris.Context) {
		ctx.ViewData("message", "Hello world!")
		ctx.View("hello.html")
	})

	app.Run(iris.Addr(":8080"))
}
```

We expect Go version 1.9 to be released in August, however you can install Go 1.9 RC2 today.

### Installing Go 1.9rc2
 
1. Go to https://golang.org/dl/#go1.9rc2
2. Download a compatible, with your OS, archive or executable, i.e `go1.9rc2.windows-amd64.zip`
3. Unzip the contents of `go1.9rc2.windows-amd64.zip` folder to your $GOROOT, i.e `C:\Go` or just execute the executable you've just download
4. Open a terminal and execute `go version`, it should output the go1.9rc2 version, i.e:
```sh
C:\Users\kataras>go version
go version go1.9rc2 windows/amd64
```

<summary>Why a new web framework</summary>

### Why

Go is a great technology stack for building scalable, web-based, back-end systems for web 
applications. 

When you think about building web applications and web APIs, or simply building HTTP servers in Go, does your mind go to the standard net/http package?
Then you have to deal with some common situations like dynamic routing (a.k.a parameterized), security and authentication, real-time communication and many other issues that net/http doesn't solve. 

The net/http package is not complete enough to quickly build well-designed back-end web systems. When you realize this, you might be thinking along these lines:

- Ok, the net/http package doesn't suit me, but there are so many frameworks, which one will work for me?!
- Each one of them tells me that it is the best. I don't know what to do!

##### The truth

I did some deep research and benchmarks with 'wrk' and 'ab' in order to choose which framework would suit me and my new project. The results, sadly, were really disappointing to me.

I started wondering if golang wasn't as fast on the web as I had read... but, before I let Golang go and continued to develop with nodejs, I told myself:

> '**Makis, don't lose hope, give at least a chance to Golang. Try to build something totally new without basing it off the "slow" code you saw earlier; learn the secrets of this language and make *others* follow your steps!**'.

These are the words I told myself that day [**13 March 2016**]. 

The same day, later the night, I was reading a book about Greek mythology. I saw an ancient goddess' name and was inspired immediately to give a name to this new web framework (which I had already started writing) - **Iris**.

 I'm still here [because Iris has succeed in being the fastest go web framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smallnest/go-web-framework-benchmark/4db507a22c964c9bc9774c5b31afdc199a0fe8b7/benchmark.png)

---- 

_iris_ is easy, it has a familiar API while in the same has far more features than [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) or [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini).

You own your code â€”it will never generate (unfamiliar) code for you, like [Beego](https://github.com/astaxie/beego), [Revel](https://github.com/revel/revel) and [Buffalo](https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo) do.

It's not just-another-router but its overall performance is equivalent with something like [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).

Unlike [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp), iris provides full HTTP/2 support for free.

Compared to the rest open source projects, this one is very active and you get answers almost immediately.

The _iris_ philosophy is to provide robust tooling for HTTP, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Keep note that, today, iris is faster than apache+nginx itself.

_iris_ does not force you to use any specific ORM. With support for the most popular template engines, websocket server and a fast sessions manager you can quickly craft your perfect application.


The awesome _iris_ community is always adding new examples, [_examples](_examples/) is a great place to get started!

Read the [godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/kataras/iris) for a better understanding.

### ðŸ“Œ Version

Current: [VERSION](VERSION)

Each new release is pushed to the master. It stays there until the next version. When a next version is released then the previous version goes to its own branch with `gopkg.in` as its import path (and its own vendor folder), in order to keep it working "for-ever".

Changelog of the current version can be found at the [HISTORY](HISTORY.md) file.

#### Should I upgrade my iris?

Developers are not forced to use the latest _iris_ version, they can use any version in production, they can update at any time they want.

Testers should upgrade immediately, if you're willing to use _iris_ in production you can wait a little more longer, transaction should be as safe as possible.

#### Where can I find older versions?

Previous versions can be found at [releases page](https://github.com/kataras/iris/releases).
